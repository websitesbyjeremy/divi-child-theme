# Divi Child Theme

To create your Divi Child theme, you will need the following:

-   Divi Theme Installed and Activated
-   [Text Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  for editing theme files. You can use the text editor that comes with Windows or Mac but if you plan on making a habit of editing these files, I suggest getting a more powerful text editor like VS Code, Atom, Notepad++, etc.
-   [FTP Client](https://filezilla-project.org/)  – This isn’t necessary if you plan on uploading your child theme to WordPress as a zip file. But if you are trying to access the theme files for a live site you will need an FTP client like FileZilla in order to be able to access, edit, add, or delete theme files. If you are working on a local install, you should be able to access the theme files directly on your hard drive.
